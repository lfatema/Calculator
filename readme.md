# Calculator 

In this CSS project, we create a cool light-dark theme calculator that performs simple mathematical calculations using basic javascript. The main intention to build this project was to play aroud with css box-shadow property by giving a good shadow effect. 

At the top-right corner we have a small toggle button to switch between the light and dark theme.

The project was developed by following the Online Tutorials youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6jxqGQduWk&t=77s)
